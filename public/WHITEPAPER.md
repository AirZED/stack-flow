- **Track successful traders** and automatically copy their moves

## The Problem

### Trading is Complicated

Most people want to grow their money, but modern trading is full of obstacles:

**1. Information Overload**
- Too many charts, indicators, and metrics to track
- News moves markets faster than individuals can react
- Hard to know which information actually matters

**2. No Clear Guidance**
- Successful traders keep their strategies secret
- No way to learn from the best without expensive courses
- Communities share opinions but not actual results

**3. Risky Platforms**
- Exchanges hold your money (you don't)
- Platform failures mean losing access to your funds
- No transparency about how your money is used

**4. Complex Strategies**
- Professional strategies require deep knowledge
- Options trading feels like learning a new language
- Most people stick to simple buy-and-hold, missing opportunities

---

## Our Solution

StackFlow solves these problems by making sophisticated trading simple, social, and secure.

### Three Core Principles

**1. Follow Success, Not Opinions**

Instead of reading what traders say, watch what they actually do. Our platform tracks wallets that consistently make profitable moves (we call them "whales" and "efficient traders"). You can automatically copy their trades with a single click.

**2. Make Community Drive Investment**

Popular culture moves markets. When a meme goes viral or sentiment shifts, money follows. StackFlow turns social signals into investment opportunities through community pools where popular ideas get funded.

**3. Simplify Advanced Strategies**

Professional traders use complex strategies for different market conditions. We've broken these down into simple choices:
- Market going up? Use bullish strategies
- Market going down? Use bearish strategies
- Market moving a lot? Use volatility strategies
- Market stable? Use stability strategies

No complicated terms. Just select what matches your market view.

## Core Features

### 1. Capital Sentiment Strategies

These are proven trading approaches organized by market conditions. Each strategy is designed for a specific scenario.

#### When You Think Prices Will Rise (Bullish)

**Call Strategy**
- **Best for:** Strong upward moves
- **How it works:** You buy the right to purchase an asset at today's price, even if the price goes higher
- **Example:** Bitcoin is $50,000. You buy a Call. If Bitcoin hits $60,000, you profit from the difference
- **Risk level:** You can only lose what you invested

**Strap Strategy**
- **Best for:** Expecting big upward move, but protecting against surprise drops
- **How it works:** Combines two Calls and one Put for asymmetric upside
- **Profit potential:** High if market rises, moderate if it falls
- **Risk level:** Moderate - costs more than a simple Call

**Bull Call Spread**
- **Best for:** Moderate price increases with limited budget
- **How it works:** Buy a Call at one price, sell a Call at a higher price
- **Profit potential:** Limited but defined - you know maximum profit upfront
- **Risk level:** Low - cheaper than a simple Call, capped losses

**Bull Put Spread**
- **Best for:** Expecting stability or slight increases
- **How it works:** Sell a Put at one price, buy a Put at a lower price
- **Profit potential:** Defined premium collected if price stays above target
- **Risk level:** Low to moderate - defined maximum loss

#### When You Think Prices Will Fall (Bearish)

**Put Strategy**
- **Best for:** Strong downward moves
- **How it works:** You buy the right to sell an asset at today's price, even if it drops
- **Example:** Bitcoin is $50,000. You buy a Put. If Bitcoin falls to $40,000, you profit
- **Risk level:** You can only lose what you invested

**Strip Strategy**
- **Best for:** Expecting big downward move, but protecting against surprise rallies
- **How it works:** Combines two Puts and one Call for asymmetric downside profit
- **Profit potential:** High if market falls, moderate if it rises
- **Risk level:** Moderate - costs more than a simple Put

**Bear Put Spread**
- **Best for:** Moderate price decreases with limited budget
- **How it works:** Buy a Put at one price, sell a Put at a lower price
- **Profit potential:** Limited but defined - you know maximum profit upfront
- **Risk level:** Low - cheaper than a simple Put, capped losses

**Bear Call Spread**
- **Best for:** Expecting stability or slight decreases
- **How it works:** Sell a Call at one price, buy a Call at a higher price
- **Profit potential:** Defined premium collected if price stays below target
- **Risk level:** Low to moderate - defined maximum loss

#### When You Expect Big Price Swings (High Volatility)

**Straddle Strategy**
- **Best for:** Major news events or uncertain markets
- **How it works:** Buy both a Call and a Put at the same price
- **Profit potential:** Win whether price goes up OR down significantly
- **Risk level:** Moderate - costs more upfront, but protected both directions
- **Note:** 10% discount on StackFlow

**Strangle Strategy**
- **Best for:** Expecting massive moves in either direction
- **How it works:** Buy a Call above current price and a Put below current price
- **Profit potential:** Very high if large move happens
- **Risk level:** Moderate to high - lower cost than Straddle but needs bigger moves

#### When You Expect Stable Prices (Low Volatility)

**Long Butterfly**
- **Best for:** Expecting price to stay near a specific level
- **How it works:** Combines multiple options at three different prices
- **Profit potential:** High profit if price lands exactly where predicted
- **Risk level:** Low - cheap to enter, limited loss

**Long Condor**
- **Best for:** Expecting price to stay within a range
- **How it works:** Similar to Butterfly but with a wider profit zone
- **Profit potential:** Decent profit if price stays in the target range
- **Risk level:** Low - affordable entry, defined maximum loss

### 2. Copy Trading

Watch what successful traders do and automatically mirror their moves.

**How We Find Successful Traders**
- Track wallet performance over time
- Analyze win rates, profit consistency, and risk management
- Rank traders by multiple metrics, not just total profit
- Update rankings daily based on recent performance

**How Copying Works**
1. Browse the top trader leaderboard
2. Review their strategy, win rate, and recent trades
3. Click "Copy Trader"
4. Set your investment amount
5. Every time they make a move, you make the same move proportionally

**Safety Features**
- Set maximum investment per trade
- Stop copying at any time
- See their full history before copying
- Your funds stay in your wallet until execution

**Customization**
- Copy 100% of their trades or just a percentage
- Set filters (only copy Bitcoin trades, not altcoins)
- Delay trades to see their results first
- Get notifications before trades execute

### 3. Meme-Driven Investing

The internet moves markets. StackFlow makes community sentiment tradable.

**How It Works**
1. Someone shares a meme or investment idea (e.g., "Bitcoin going to $100k")
2. Community votes on whether they agree
3. If enough support, a community pool opens
4. People contribute funds to the pool
5. The pool executes trades based on the meme's prediction
6. Profits or losses are shared proportionally

**Examples**
- "Laser eyes meme resurging → Bitcoin bullish"
- "Crypto Twitter bearish sentiment → Short-term puts"
- "Major protocol upgrade next month → Volatility play"

**Safety Measures**
- Minimum vote threshold before pool activates
- Transparent strategy for each pool
- Time limits on investment thesis
- Clear profit/loss distribution rules

**Community Rewards**
- Meme creators earn a small percentage if their pool profits
- Top voters get reputation points
- Active participants get priority in future pools

## Team & Vision

### Our Mission

Make sophisticated trading accessible to everyone while keeping Bitcoin's core values: decentralization, transparency, and self-sovereignty.

### Why We're Building This

Current trading platforms force you to choose:
- Simple platforms with limited strategies
- Complex platforms with steep learning curves
- Custodial convenience vs. self-custody security

StackFlow refuses this compromise. You get simplicity, power, and security together.

### Principles We Follow

**1. User First**
- Every feature must serve user needs
- Complexity hidden, power preserved
- Earn trust through transparency
- Listen to community feedback

**2. Security Always**
- Non-custodial is non-negotiable
- Audit everything before launch
- Expect attacks and prepare defenses
- Transparent about risks

**3. Community Owned**
- Open-source core components
- Fair token distribution (future)
- Governance by users, not founders
- Share success with contributors

**4. Bitcoin Values**
- Leverage Bitcoin's security
- Support decentralization
- Resist censorship
- Empower individuals

## Why Stacks? Why Bitcoin?

### Bitcoin's Unmatched Security

Bitcoin is the most secure blockchain:
- $500+ billion in value secured
- 15+ years without successful attack
- Massive global mining network
- Proven resilience

Other chains offer faster transactions or cheaper fees, but none match Bitcoin's security track record.

### Stacks Brings Programmability

Bitcoin alone can't run complex programs like StackFlow. Stacks adds this capability while maintaining Bitcoin security:

**Technical Benefits**
- Smart contracts that settle on Bitcoin
- Bitcoin finality for major transactions
- Clarity programming language (safer than Solidity)
- Access to Bitcoin's liquidity

**User Benefits**
- Your funds backed by Bitcoin's security
- Lower fees than Bitcoin mainnet
- Faster transaction confirmation
- Future Bitcoin DeFi access (sBTC)

### Growing Ecosystem

Stacks has momentum:
- Nakamoto upgrade (faster blocks)
- sBTC launch (1:1 Bitcoin peg)
- Major DeFi protocols launching
- Institutional interest growing

StackFlow rides this wave while the ecosystem is early.
